<b>ServiceQ</b>

ServiceQ is a TCP layer for parallel service deployments. It distributes load across multiple endpoints and buffer requests on error (in scenarios of downtimes, service unavailability, connection loss etc). The buffered requests are forwarded when the service is available next.

Noticeable features -

* HTTP Load Balancing<br/>
* Request retries<br/>
* In-memory request queueing and replay<br/>
* Concurrent connections limit<br/>
* Add timeout to forwarded requests<br/>
* Add response headers<br/>
* Configurable balancer properies<br/>
* Error detection<br/>
